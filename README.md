## Installations

Copy contents of `install.js` from this repo into your BitBurner game and run to install!

## Changelog

### v0.0.1

* An actual GitHub repo!
* Something of a proper architecture, but still very WIP...
* UI components in their own files... Almost like Vue SFCs, but decidedly more punk
* Reactive data stores syncing NetScript and Vue UI layers âš¡ 
* An event bus for communicating across modules ðŸšŒ 
* The beginnings of a central dashboard (something of an example of what can be done with the library thus far)

## Troubleshooting

* Please create a GitHub issue if you run into any snags with installation or use. 
* If anything crashes, kill the script pid and run `_smolGumball.ui.vueApp.unmount()` in devtools / debug console to tear it down. 
  * Doing a hard restart of your game will work too.
